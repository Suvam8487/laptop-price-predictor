## 🧠 Model Building

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed outliers and inconsistent entries
   - Unified similar categories (e.g., processor names)

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created new features like PPI (Pixels Per Inch)
   - Encoded categorical variables using Label/One-Hot Encoding

3. **Modeling**:
   - Tried various regression algorithms:
     - Linear Regression
     - Ridge, Lasso
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest Regressor
     - Gradient Boosting
